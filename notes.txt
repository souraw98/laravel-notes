laravel like other framework follow strict design pattern.
All the 23-desing pattern are implemented in laravel
that is why strong knowledge of oops is required.

laravel like other framework uses MVC Concept.
M:model 
******
	All the database related part, and database Query logic
	like database connection, database Query, Querybuilder(Eloquent
	) 
	every thing comes under,model.
	type of class (core file)
V:views
*******
	Views Refers the Templates or HTML views, like form,
	about us, contacts us, etc etc.
	Views are responsible to handling the, presentation part 
	of web-app or you can views are resposible for 
	front end
	All the files related to front end are related to views.
	Every views file in laravel is called blade(any-name.blade.php) file.
	it is type hybrid file

C:controller : 
**************

	it is also a type of class (core file)
	controller is middle man, or intermediate component
	B/w views and model

	How it works:-
	************
	Any Request coming from views it will send controller and
	controller with then send to, model to update the db.
	
     Similary any changes in db will seen by model and send the controller to render in thview.

Postmortem of laravel
*********************
Directory Structure of laravel
1. Projectfolder :<root-folder>
		It is complete Package of Laravel Collections.
		The name of project is actually a clone of project download by composer 
		from packagist.org with packagename laravel/laravel
		The name of folder depends what name has been given when installed during, installation.
		via composer.
		
		This the main folder.
		Everything you will find inside this only.

Folder structure inside laravel Project folder
***********************************************
	1. app folder:	
			this is main folder where entire application bussiness logic is put
			like, all middleware(security), all service provider                        (RouteServiceProvider,SchemaServiceProvider), all controller, all models,
			all Exception, packages path(kernel.php), all console command are found 
			here, the beauty of this folder each file in folder is core file and uses 
			strict concept of oops and the file made inside these folders will be class files
			only full of serveral namespaces.

			The Request from public/index.php will be send to composer.json from where
			psr-4 path we acquired, as app and will be send to bootstrap/app.php to bootstrap
			the application which is,registered inside kernel.php and kernel.php will return
			the package path Illuminate/framework/src path which will used by
			vendor/autoload.php to handle any type of operation distributed according to the 
			package.
			
			1. console : This is the folder that, contains all the files related to user
				defined console commands,which is generated by user by using
				php artisan make:command <command-name>

			    	1. kernel.php file
				2. commands Folder : it will contain all the important class file
					for the user-defined class now this user defined class
					can have a logic which may require, laravel inbuilt package,
					for any database operation like Eloquent for this you will 
					need package path to vendor/Eloquent so for sapi name = 'cli-server'
					who will provide, package path here kernel.php will provide
					the path to vendor/autoload.php for, cli-server

					user-defined-class command files
					...
					...
					...

				3. Exception : This folder contains any type of, Exceptions which 
						need to be handle at application level globally.
						Handler.php : This is perticular file where
						we register, every type of Exception need to be handled.
						we can use try catch blocks if not each logic 
						is already b/w try and catch block which is managed
						by laravel internally.

				what is meaning of csrf token?
				csrf : cross site request forgery.
