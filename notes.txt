why laravel
***********
1. very very easy
2. Highly upgradable,packages
3. highly scalable
4. open source : you need not to spend single paisa at all.
5. highly secure
6. largest community in the world, github.com, laracast.com, stackoverflow

who is founder of laravel:-
taylor otwell

one cannot complete laravel in one to 7 Birth.
Illuminate\Package


Example in order to mail laravel will use phpmailer package.
laravel ---> phpmailer overview
phpmailer ----> github repository ---> readme.md file
carbon ----> Date and time manage ---> readme.md file

Understand why we require framework?
************************************
1. Consider I want to chicken Biryani, now you have two options
	1. goto some tundey kababi and pay amount and eat done
	2. Market ---> Egg ---> Chick --->  In Big Chicken -->
	-----> cut into pieces --> cook ---> eat.
framework : it is collection of packages, classes, methods and 
inbuilt functionalities.

How to install laravel
**********************
1. make sure you have composer installed.
	open cmd ---> type ---> composer -v 2.x
	the composer is installed or else not installed.

goto getcomposer.org
     download composer (.exe)
     
what is composer:-

1. composer is a dependency manager tool.
2. composer can be used to install any new package and upgrade to any new package.
3. All the pacakages are donwloaded from packagist.org server.
4. composer is a type package manager tool.

composer is same as pip in python
composer is same as npm in node
composer is same as apt in linux

How to install laravel
**********************
1. using laravel/installer
	composer global require laravel/installer (first-time)
	laravel new <project-name>  (any-time)

2. using composer create-project command
	composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel <project-name> (any-time)

How to run laravel application
*****************************
goto inside project-folder
1. artisan file : anonymous file
   .env file : anoynous file

php artisan serve
	    [commmand Argument]
artisan : command line argument tool for laravel

laravel like other framework follow strict design pattern.
All the 23-desing pattern are implemented in laravel
that is why strong knowledge of oops is required.

laravel like other framework uses MVC Concept.
M:model 
******
	All the database related part, and database Query logic
	like database connection, database Query, Querybuilder(Eloquent
	) 
	every thing comes under,model.
	type of class (core file)
V:views
*******
	Views Refers the Templates or HTML views, like form,
	about us, contacts us, etc etc.
	Views are responsible to handling the, presentation part 
	of web-app or you can views are resposible for 
	front end
	All the files related to front end are related to views.
	Every views file in laravel is called blade(any-name.blade.php) file.
	it is type hybrid file

C:controller : 
**************

	it is also a type of class (core file)
	controller is middle man, or intermediate component
	B/w views and model

	How it works:-
	************
	Any Request coming from views it will send controller and
	controller with then send to, model to update the db.
	
     Similary any changes in db will seen by model and send the controller to render in thview.

Postmortem of laravel
*********************
Directory Structure of laravel
1. Projectfolder :<root-folder>
		It is complete Package of Laravel Collections.
		The name of project is actually a clone of project download by composer 
		from packagist.org with packagename laravel/laravel
		The name of folder depends what name has been given when installed during, installation.
		via composer.
		
		This the main folder.
		Everything you will find inside this only.

Folder structure inside laravel Project folder
***********************************************
	1. app folder:	
			this is main folder where entire application bussiness logic is put
			like, all middleware(security), all service provider                        (RouteServiceProvider,SchemaServiceProvider), all controller, all models,
			all Exception, packages path(kernel.php), all console command are found 
			here, the beauty of this folder each file in folder is core file and uses 
			strict concept of oops and the file made inside these folders will be class files
			only full of serveral namespaces.

			The Request from public/index.php will be send to composer.json from where
			psr-4 path we acquired, as app and will be send to bootstrap/app.php to bootstrap
			the application which is,registered inside kernel.php and kernel.php will return
			the package path Illuminate/framework/src path which will used by
			vendor/autoload.php to handle any type of operation distributed according to the 
			package.
			
			1. console : This is the folder that, contains all the files related to user
				defined console commands,which is generated by user by using
				php artisan make:command <command-name>

			    	1. kernel.php file
				2. commands Folder : it will contain all the important class file
					for the user-defined class now this user defined class
					can have a logic which may require, laravel inbuilt package,
					for any database operation like Eloquent for this you will 
					need package path to vendor/Eloquent so for sapi name = 'cli-server'
					who will provide, package path here kernel.php will provide
					the path to vendor/autoload.php for, cli-server

					user-defined-class command files
					...
					...
					...

				3. Exception : This folder contains any type of, Exceptions which 
						need to be handle at application level globally.
						Handler.php : This is perticular file where
						we register, every type of Exception need to be handled.
						we can use try catch blocks if not each logic 
						is already b/w try and catch block which is managed
						by laravel internally.

				what is meaning of csrf token?
				csrf : cross site request forgery.
				
				4. http :- This folder contains all the controller
					middlewares, Kernel.php
					 
					 middleware : It contains all the middleware
					 related to security which will be automatically,
					 Running at Request and Response before sending
					 to controller.
					 
					 Example predefined, middleware
					 1. VerifyCsrfToken
					 2. TrustProxies
					 3. EncryptCookies
					 4. TrustHosts
					 5. TrimString
					 6. RedirectIfAuthenticated
					 ...
					 ...
					 ...
										[ Filter ]
					 Request -------> | Middleware | ------> Response
					 Request <--------| Middleware | <-----Response
										[ Filter ]
					 
					 You can make your own custom middleware using
					 command 
					 php artisan make:middleware <middleware-name>
					 
					 Controller : All the controller will reside, 
					 inside controllers Folder only.
					 
					 
				5. Models :- Models are responsible for managing
				Query logical and database related information,
				And Joins/Relationships.
				
				All Models, placed are, Integral Part of MVC.
				
				What is Eloquent? : Query Builder name is Eloquent.
				it is type of package and found inside, vendor.
				
				What is Doctrine?
				It is name of ORM, Package
				
				Do you remeber :-
				1. mysqli_fetch_objects()
				
				user   ----------> Class
					id ----------> Attribute :instance Variable.
					name ---------> Attribute : intance variable.
					class --------> Attribute : instance variable.
					
				What is ORM? 
					Object Relationships Mapping(RDBMS) 
					It is relational, Database.
					All the Table Schema, Database Schema will mapped
					with class and Object.
					
					
					How to Convert Student Schema in ORM?
					Class Student{
					
					private $name;
					private $class;
					private $email;
					private $id;
					private $marks;
					
					public function add(){
						// Insert Logic
					
					}
					
					public function update(){
						
						//Update Logic
					
					}
					
					public function delete(){
						//Delete Logic
					}
					
					}
					
					**************
					Why to use ORM?
					***************
					
					It has inbuilt Schema design, which enable 
					easy setup of joins without writing the Complex
					Queries these are called as relationships.
					
					We will perform postmortem on relationship.
					
					************************
					Types of relationships
					************************
					1. one-to-many.
					2. many-to-many.
					3. inverse.
					4. one to one.
					5. polymorphic.
					
					
					6. Providers:-
						These contains All Class for service providers.
						These Service Provides will be used to run 
						any services, in bootstrapping.
						
						Eg: All the Authentication service
						will be managed by, AuthServiceProvider
						
						SchemaServiceProvider : All the Database
						Related Schema Services will be Applied
						Here
						
						RouteServiceProvider : All the custom Routes,
						And Routes will be registered here.
						
				
				What is use of kernel.php in middleware?
				1. When we create any middleware, we need to register
					the Custom Middleware Path to Kernel.php
					then only it will Run.
				
					
				bootstrap : It is most Important Folder with file name app.php
				located inside this,it will bootstrap(bootload) the Entire Application, So that EveryR equest can enter, app folder
				
				It is Core Part of Laravel Framework.
				
					Cache : generally cache is used, to optimise the Performance
					You might knowing, cache Management
					
					
					In Memory
					Process 1 ---------[Cache Memory]----------> Memory (Original Source)
					
					Ram Execution <----------------[Cache if not found]----> Original Memory
					
					Images : Link
					
					First Time Images Laod time 
					Next Time Internet Off Images Load
					Browser will cache them
					
					Inside bootstrap folder we have cache folder
					There may n no of classes or packages running parallely
					Model A and Model B.
					
					Server ---> Traffic --->
					1 ---> Model A 
					2 ---> Model B
					3 ---> Model A 
					4 ---> Model A
							Model A Copy ----> Cache Memory
							Request is directly Proportional to caching
							
					There is one problem with cache?
						1. 
						
						Model A Cache 
						Model A Some new Data added or some new path Added.
						then we require to clear cache.
						
						php artisan cache:clear
						
						
				2. Config Folder : This Folder will contain, Important configuration
					or settings, it is, same as settings.php but all the different types 
					of settings has been classified inform of of different files
					like 
					All the settings and configuration are used from config folder
					which are not configured at .env
					There may a chance that, few settings may be common for .env and config folder
					important config files
					app.php  : Application Configurations.
					auth.php : Authentication Configurations.
					broadcasting.php : Broadcasting Configurations.
					cache.php : Cache Configurations
					cors.php : cross origin resource sharing policy settings.
					database.php : All the database Configurations
					filesystems.php : All the Uploaded files will be stored here.
					hashing.php : All the hashing Algorithm, will be stored here. 
					logging.php : All the cache, logs error logs will be confgured.
					mail.php : if you want to send and use smtp mail settings the we go for,
							   we use mail.php.
					queue.php : it will contains settings to run multiple process related to aws, 
								beanstack, redis etc.
					sanctum.php : NA
					services.php : All the settings Related to service providers.
					session.php : All the settings related to, session drivers etc,
					view.php : All the settings related to, views.
					
					database : 
						1. factories : Design Pattern ---> Factory Design Pattern, 
									   here we create the Different Objects in Bulk.
						2. migrations : Here we create table schema, and as soon we 
										enter the command php artisan migrate
										Table schema is created,
						3. seeders : it refers to seeds (Records) which can be generated inside 
									  database in just one second
									  You can upload lakh lakh of data using seeders
									  
									  For Eg:-
									  Ecommerce : we can use faker module to generate fake data.
									  
									  
					public : it is folder where all the request are forwarded, it acts as a entry 
					point to, Application such that entire request goes inside public/index.php
					file.
					
					1. htaccess : Apache Handler file with important, configuration
								  with different setting,security, environment , rewrite Rules
								  Required to run laravel Application.
					2. robot.txt : it is special file used for SEO, and Blogging google crawlers
						or search Engine will scan for robot.txt file only.
					3. index.php : It is main file which acts as a, entry point to the application.
					4. favicon : it laravel favicon icon.
					
					
					Why name public ?
					it refers to public_html in the web-hosting (web-server)
					
					It provides, security due to which use can move / forward in the url 
					but not backward suppose if index.php was not inside, public folder
					and this file would have been placed parallely to app,bootsrap,config,resources,
					database,... so if index.php file is deleted, then all the folder structure 
					would be visible and this could lead to security threat and hacking of the
					application so inorder to protect this we use .htaccess with forbidden error
					Options -Indexes : permission denied
					Options +Indexes : Access 
					
					Suppose we dont have, index.php about.php home.php xyz.php 404.php
					
					DirectoryIndex index.php about.php home.php xyz.php 404.php
									[0]      [1]       [2]      [3]      [4]
												
					Resources : This folder is respsonsible for assests(
					images,js,css,icons,favicons,audio,vedio,langauges,views,html pages,blade files...)
						
					This folder contains, pre-compiled files of js,css, and other files.
					SASS : simple Auwesome Style sheet,(Programmable css, loops, keywords
					varaibles...)
					
					when you run single command all the css,js, and Other files will
					generated a single app.js or single app.css so and will 
					be generated inside public/css or public/images or public/icons,
					public/fonts....
					
						1. css  : pre-compiled css
						2. js  :  pre-compiled js
						3. lang : All the langauges, folder
						4. views : welcome.blade.php : 
									php artisan serve landing from this path only.
									
									
									
					
					What will you make multi-lingual site ?
					
					1. in order to make a application which support multiple
					langauge what you have to do, is inside resource folder,
					we have lang folder inside lang / en /
					we have multiple files for validation, paginations, rules...
					what will happen if we want to change the, langauge content
					from en to hindi or en to french or en to german
					
					lang
					  |-
						|-en
							validation.php 
								return [
								
								'alpha' => 'The :attribute must contain only letter'
								
								];
						|-hindi
							validation.php 
								return [
								
								'alpha' => 'Is :attribute mey letter hona chaiye'
								
								];
						|-german
						|-french
					
					
					Routes:-
					This folder contains all the url mapped with the resources.
					using http methods
					
					Route::get('/users',function(){
						return view('users');
					});
				
					Route::get() : Direct 
					Route::post() : with csrf token
					Route::put() : with csrf token + _method = PUT.
					Route::patch() : with csrf token + _method = PATCH.
					Route::Delete() : with csrf token + _method = DELETE.
							
					1. web.php : All url related to wep-app.
					2. api.php : All the Api will be used by api.php.
					3. channel.php : All the BroadCasting Routes (Network, webshockets,)
					4. console.php : we can make our own command using php artisan
									 if we want to make our own routes or urls for console, in console.php.
									 
					Lets a Build Few Routes, using web.php inside Routes

					Laravel Directory Structure for Routes is different in version
					less than <=5.8
					
					app
					 |---> Routes.
					 
					>=5.8.+ x.version.
					
					app
					Routes.
					
					
					
How to create Api in laravel
****************************
1. using Controller,and models
2. using resources : Route::resource('AnyResource');
	How to see list of routes
	**************************
	php artisan route:list
	
						 
How to work with Query Builder:-

1. $user = User::all() : select * from users;
2. $user = User::find(id);
3. $user = User::find()->where()->get()

4. 	$user = new User();
	$user->name = 'some name';
	$user->email = 'some@gmail.com';
	$user->pass = '1234';
	$user->save();

5. $user = User::find($id);
   $user->name = 'new-name';
   $user->email='new@email.com';
   $user->pass = 'new@password';
   $user->save();
   
6. $user = User::find($id);
   $user->delete();
   
  
Lets us create a Model
************************
php artisan make:model <model-name>
php artisan make:model Student

Once Model is Ready? 
We need a Migration:-
php artisan make:migration create_table_for_students

We need to Set Up Database Connections:-
goto .env and add the values like
hostname,
username,
password,
dbname

Once database connection is ready we need to run first migrations.
Why we need to run migrations:-
1. because laravel maintain, few intial tables like, migrations,users,passwords,session,
   failed_password tables.
   
   php artisan migrate --pretend : to show the Query of migrations
   php artisan migrate:status : to see current migration status.
   php artisan migrate : all the migrations and table schema will executed.
   
   Note :: migrations hold the table schema, and models hold the data.
   
   
  step 1: php artisan make:migration create_table_student
		goto database/migration/create_table_student.php 
		
		public function up(){
		
			Schema::create('student', function (Blueprint $table) {
            
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name',191);
            $table->string('email',191)->unique();
            $table->string('mobile',20)->nullable();
            
        });
		
		}
  
  
		public function down() //migrate:rollback
		{
			Schema::dropIfExists('student');
		}
					
				
		php artisan migrate
		Migrations done succesfully.
		Now create some dummy record in table student.
		
		
		How to create model
		********************
		php artisan make:model <Student>
		Model created successfully.
		
		goto folder app/models/Student.php
		
		We have to create Resource 
		**************************
		php artisan make:resource <Student>
		Resource created successfully.
		
		A Resource is like controller, which all ready methods.
		goto app/controller/Student
		
		php artisan make:controller StudentController --resource
		app/http/controller/StudentController.php
		
		index : show the data.
		create : create the form.
		store : insert the data.
		show : single record with some-id.
		edit : form for edit record.
		update : update the data.
		destroy : delete the record. 
		
		For Api :-
		1. get,put,delete,post
		   
		   get : index all  
		   get : show single 
		   post : store
		   put : update
		   delete :destroy
		   
		   
		We have to create Route for Resource:-
		 use App\http\Controller\StudentController; //namespaces
		 
		1. Route::resource('/student','StudentController');
		php artisan route:list -c 
		
		// Route::resource('/students','\App\Http\Controllers\StudentController');
		//or
		Route::resource('/students',StudentController::class);
		
		
		Note : get_student_data : snake case
		     : getStudentData :camel 
			 : GetStudentData : parscal 
			 : get-student-data : kebab case
			 
		if you are using model to table schema:-
		singular ---> plural 
		Model -----> Models 
		student -----> Students
		StudentResult ---> student_results
		
		custom naming convetion : model ---> protected $table='<any-name-any-case>';
